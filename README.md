**Advisor Statement**:

This paper develops a deep-generative model for reasoning about similarities between participants and stimuli in fMRI experiments. Eli worked on this paper over a period of over 2 years. In this time, he lead development of the original model, carried out the majority of the numerical experiments, and contributed a substantial portion of the writing. Zulqarnain Khan, Eli's collaborator in Engineering shares joint lead-author credit on this paper, owing to substantial contributions at a later stage in the project to further experiments helped validate the approach from a neuroscientific perspective. I would say that Eli has contributed a level of effort that (in isolation from Zulqarnain's contributions) should be considered more than sufficient for a Khoury paper requirement.
